# GeoAc
Infrasonic ray tracing code

GeoAc is a numerical package written in C++ which solves the equations governing acoustic 
propagation through the atmosphere in the geometric limit using a RK4 algorithm.  It contains
multiple instances of said equation system and is able to model propagation in an azimuthal 
plane using the effective motionless medium approximation as well as in three dimensions 
using an inhomogeneous moving background medium.  The three dimensional propagation scheme 
include methods to model propagation in a Cartesian coordinate system as well as a spherical 
coordinate system which incorporates the curvature of the earth. 

See manual for more information.
